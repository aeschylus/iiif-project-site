                        <p>
                        This document describes an API proposed by the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) group for the delivery of images via a standard http request. The IIIF API specifies a web service that returns an image in response to a standard http or https request. The URL can specify the region, size, rotation, quality characteristics and format of the requested image. A URL can also be constructed to request basic technical information about the image to support client applications.  The IIIF API was conceived of to facilitate systematic reuse of image resources in digital image repositories maintained by cultural heritage organizations. The API could be adopted by any image repository or service, and can be used to retrieve static images in response to a properly constructed URL.

                    <!-- Section 2: URL Syntax -->

                        <h2><a id="url-syntax" name="url-syntax">2. URL Syntax</a><a href="#toc" class="link-toc"><img src="img/icon-toc.png"></a></h2>
                        <p>
                        The IIIF Image API can be called in two forms: one to request an image, and a second to request techincal information about the image. Both forms convey the request's information in the path segment of the URI, rather than as query parameters. This makes responses more easily able to be cached, either at the server or by standard web-caching infrastructure. It also permits a minimal implementation using pre-computed files in a matching directory structure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        To allow for extension, this specification does not define the behaviour of an implementing server when it receives requests that do not match one of the two request syntaxes below.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Section 2.1: Image Request URL Syntax -->

                        <p>
                        The IIIF Image API URL for requesting an image MUST conform to the following format:<br/>
                        <pre class="indent">http[s]://server/[prefix/]identifier/region/size/rotation/quality[.format]</pre>
                        where [] delimits components which are optional.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The URI Template (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750" class="ext-link">RFC6750</a>) form is:<br/>
                        <pre class="indent">http://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}/{region}/{size}/{rotation}/{quality}{.format}</pre>
                        For example:<br/>
                        <pre class="indent">http://www.example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/full/0/native.jpg</pre>

                        <p>
                        The API places no restrictions on the form of the identifiers that a server may use or support, although the identifier MUST be expressed as a string. All special characters (e.g. ? or #) MUST be URI encoded to avoid unpredictable client behaviors. The URL syntax relies upon slash (/) separators so any slashes in the identifier MUST be URI encoded (aka. percent-encoded, replace / with %2F ). See discussion in <a href="#url-encoding-and-decoding">Section 9 - URL Encoding and Decoding</a>.

                        <p>
                        All parameters described below are required for compliant construction of a IIIF image API URL. The sequence of parameters in the URL MUST be in the order described below. The order of the parameters is also intended as the order of the operations by which the service should manipulate the image content. Thus, the image content is first extracted as a region of the source image, then scaled to the requested size, rotated and transformed into the color depth and format. This resulting image content is returned as the representation for the URL. All transformations are performed within the bounds of integer arithmatic.  The rounding method is not specified.  Floating point numbers should be have at most 10 decimal digits and consist only of decimal digits and â.â with a leading zero if less than 1.

                        The region parameter defines the rectangular portion of the source image to be returned. Region can be specified by pixel coordinates, percentage or by the value âfullâ, which specifies that the entire region of the source image should be returned.

                        The rotation value represents the number of degrees of clockwise rotation from the original, and may be any floating point number from 0 to 360. Initially most services will only support 0, 90, 180 or 270 as valid values.

                        <p>
                        In most cases a rotation will change the width and height dimensions of the returned image file.  The service SHOULD return an image file that contains all of the image contents requested in the region and size parameters, even if the dimensions of the returned image file are different than specified in the size parameter.  The image contents SHOULD NOT be scaled  as a result of the rotation, and there SHOULD be no additional space between the corners of the rotated image contents and the bounding box of the returned image file.

                        <p>
                        For non-90-degree rotations the API does not specify the background color.

The server may either do 200 (return the representation in the response) or 30x (redirect to the correct URI with a format extension) style content negotiation. If neither are given, then the server should use a default format of its own choosing.

                        The sequence of parameters in the URL is intended to express the order in which image manipulations are made against the original. This is important to consider when implementing the service because applying the same parameters in a different sequence will often result in a different image being delivered. The order is critical so that the application calling the service reliably receives the output it expects.

                        Servers may transmit HTTP responses with status codes 200, 302 and 304 when the request has been successfully processed.  If the status code is 200, then the entity-body MUST be the requested image or information response.  If the status code is 302 or 304, then the entity-body is unrestricted, but it is RECOMMENDED to be empty.  If the status code is 302, then the Location HTTP Header MUST be set containing the URL of the image that fulfills the request.  This enables servers to have a single canonical URL to promote caching of responses.  Status code 304 is handled exactly as per the HTTP specification. Clients should therefore expect to encounter all of these situations and not assume that the entity-body of the initial response necessarily contains the image data.

                        This API does not specify whether the image server will support authentication or what mechanism it might use. In the case of  "401 Unauthorized" HTTP error response, the content of the WWW-Authenticate header will depend on the authentication mechanism supported by the server. If the server supports HTTP Basic or Digest authentication then the header should follow <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617" class="ext-link">RFC2617</a>, for example:
                        <p>
                        <pre class="no-indent">
              WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Images"
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                        If the server supports cookie-based authentication then the response should include the location of the page that will allow the user to login:
                        </p>
                        <pre class="no-indent">
              WWW-Authenticate: Cookie location="https://example.com/login&amp;redirect={URI}"
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                        Where {URI} is a template parameter that SHOULD be used if the login server supports redirection after login. A client MUST substitute the current page URI in place of {URI} before presenting a login link to the user. Note that while there is widespread agreement that the limitation of WWW-Authenticate to Basic and Digest authentication in the current HTTP specification, there is no standard way to indicate appropriate redirection to a login screen, or convey a URI template to insert a return URI.

                        A service SHOULD specify on all responses the extent to which the API is supported. This is done by including an HTTP Link header (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988" class="ext-link">RFC5988</a>) entry pointing to the description of the highest level of conformance of which ALL of the requirements are met. The ârelâ type to be used is âprofileâ, and thus a complete header might look like:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Link:
                        </p>
                        <pre class="no-indent">&lt;http://library.stanford.edu/iiif/image-api/compliance.html#level0&gt;;rel="profile"</pre>
                        <p>
                        An image server MAY declare different compliance levels for different images. If the compliance level is not indicated, then a client should assume level 0 compliance only. For detailed compliance definitions see <a href="http://library.stanford.edu/iiif/image-api/compliance.html">http://library.stanford.edu/iiif/image-api/compliance.html</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The compliance profile URI given in the Link header (between &lt; and &gt;) may also be returned in the profile element of responses to Image Information Requests.

                        <h2><a id="url-encoding-and-decoding" name="url-encoding-and-decoding">9. URL Encoding and Decoding</a><a href="#toc" class="link-toc"><img src="img/icon-toc.png"></a></h2>
                        <p>
                        The URL syntax of this API relies upon slash (/) separators which MUST NOT be encoded. Clients MUST percent-encode special characters (the to-encode set below: percent and gen-delims of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986" class="ext-link">RFC3986</a> except the colon) within the components of requests. For example, any slashes within the identifier part of the URL MUST be percent-encoded. Encoding is necessary only for the identifier because other components will not include special characters.
                        </p>
                        <pre class="no-indent">to-encode = "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@" / "%"</pre>
                        <p>
                        Upon receiving an API request, a server MUST first split the URL path on slashes and then decode any percent-encoded characters in each component.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Additionally, if identifiers include any characters outside the US-ASCII set then the encoding to octets must be defined consistently on client and server, and the octets MUST be percent-encoded. Percent-encoding other characters introduces no ambiguity but is unnecessary.
                        <p>

                        Servers which are incapable of processing arbitrarily encoded identifiers SHOULD make their best efforts to expose only image identifiers for which typical clients will not encode any of the characters, and thus it is RECOMMENDED to limit characters in identifiers to letters, numbers and the underscore character.

                        <p>
                        This API defines a URI syntax and the semantics associated with its components. The composition of URIs has few security considerations except possible exposure of sensitive information in URIs or revealing of browse/view behavior of users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Server applications implementing this API must consider possible denial-of-service attacks, and authentication vulnerabilities based on DNS spoofing. Applications must be careful to parse incoming requests (URIs) in ways that avoid overflow or injection attacks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Early sanity checking of URIâs (lengths, trailing GET, invalid characters, out-of-range parameters) and rejection with appropriate response codes is recommended.

                            <li>For use cases that enable the saving of the image, it is RECOMMENDED to use the HTTP Content-Disposition header (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6266" class="ext-link">RFC6266</a>) to provide a convenient filename that distinguishes the image, based on the identifier and parameters provided.</li>
                            <li>This specification makes no assertion about the rights status of requested images or metadata, whether or not authentication has been accomplished.  Please see the IIIF Metadata API for rights information.</li>
                            <li>This API does not specify how image servers fulfill requests, what quality the returned images will have for different parameters, or how parameters may affect performance. See the compliance document for more discussion.</li>
                            <li>Image identifiers that include the slash (/ %2F) or backslash (\ %5C) characters may cause problems with some HTTP servers. Apache servers from version 2.2.18 support the "AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode" (link to <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/mod/core.html#allowencodedslashes" class="ext-link">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/mod/core.html#allowencodedslashes</a>) configuration directive which will correctly pass these characters to client applications without rejecting or decoding them. Servers using older versions of Apache and local identifiers which include these characters will need to use a workaround such as internally translating or escaping slash and backslash to safe value (perhaps by double URL-encoding them).</li>
                            <li> As described in <a href="#parameters-rotation">Section 4.2 (Rotation)</a>, in order to retain the size of the requested image contents, rotation will change the width and height dimensions of the returned image file. A formula for calculating the dimensions of the returned image file for a given rotation can be found <a href="http://www-sul.stanford.edu/iiif/image-api/rotation_calc.html">here</a>.</li>

                        IIIF Metadata

                        The IIIF group is working to define a metadata specification to drive common image viewer requirements. This specification will focus on structural metadata and minimal labeling, with the expectation that descriptive or content-related metadata will be environment- or institution-speicfic. The initial use-cases will explore different image-based content types (eg., newspapers, medieval manuscripts, maps, photos, ephemera, single sheet manuscripts...)

                        Further, the group will define specifications for a common search service, or an API that returns search results and text (OCR) coordinate data (to enable hit highlighting).    

                        Work on the metadata API will proceed through the summer of 2012.

                        Strawman Metadata / Search API Proposal
                        Authors: Rob Sanderson, Ben Albritton
                        Overview

                        This proposal is food-for-thought for the December 2012 meeting at Stanford regarding the DMS Commons and IIIF requirements for APIs beyond the one already specified for images, and the Shared Canvas data model.

                        The document looks at two aspects: metadata and search. Metadata is defined for this purpose as including only the information needed to render a page of the object represented in the Shared Canvas model. It does not include rich descriptive metadata, administrative metadata, or similar. Search is defined as the process by which a user enters a query, and the system responds with matching resources. It is only defined at the level of a single object, not between objects, and thus is not a generalized discovery tool.

                        Metadata Fields

                        As per previous discussions in the IIIF community, there are several fields which are deemed essential to present to a user, and further fields that are highly desirable and cross-community.

                        These metadata fields should be applied to the Manifest (representing the Object), the Sequences, Canvases, Ranges, and resources used to paint the Canvas.

                        The fields are as follows:

                        Requirement Ontology    Description
                        Identifier  Manifest URI    Identifier for the object. Required in RDF for all resources.
                        Title   rdfs:label  A human readable label to be presented to the user that names or describes the resource. Required for Manifest and Canvas; Recommended for all other resources.
                        Agent   sc:agentLabel   A human readable label describing or naming an agent involved with the production or conservation of the resource. The role of the agent may be included in the label, and should not be assumed to be author.
                        Date    sc:dateLabel    A human readable label giving a date of an important event in the life cycle of the resource. The type of date may be included in the label, and should not be assumed to be that of creation.
                        Location    sc:locationLabel    A human readable label given the location of an important event involved in the life cycle of the resource. The role of the location may be included in the label, and should not be assumed to be that of creation.
                        Related Description sc:relatedDescription   A richer description of the resource is available at the referenced URI
                        Related Service sc:relatedService   A service that provides interaction capabilities with the resource is available at the referenced URI. For example, an implementation of the IIIF Image API.
                        Height  exif:height The height of the resource. Mandatory for Canvas and Image.
                        Width   exif:width  The width of the resource. Mandatory for Canvas and Image.
                        Format  dc:format   The mimetype of the resource. Recommended for all resources, such as images and texts, to be rendered by a consuming application.
                        Type    rdf:type    The overall type of the resource to be rendered, following the recommendations of the Open Annotation data model.
                        These fields are sufficient to render the object, however this is a data model, not an API to retrieve the serialized model.

                        Metadata API

                        The following API provides a set of recommended URI patterns in to which the Shared Canvas data model is serialized and made available.

                        Common URI Pattern Parameters:

                        Parameter   Description
                        scheme  Either âhttpâ or âhttpsâ
                        host    The hostname of the system providing the service
                        prefix  An optional prefix below the host
                        identifier  A short identifier, following the IIIF rules, of the object being represented
                        type    The distinguishing type within the data model of the resource identified
                        name    A name for the resource that serves as the distinguishing token for the resource within its context
                        Manifest:
                        scheme://host/prefix/identifier[.fmt]

                        This pattern is the identifier for the ORE Aggregation that represents the Manifest of the other resources needed to make up the display of the object. When dereferencing the URI, the system will issue a 303 redirect to a serialization (the ORE Resource Map) in RDF/XML, Turtle or JSON-LD. This serialization will have the same URI with the format extension appended.

                        Sequence:
                        scheme://host/prefix/identifier/type/name[.fmt]

                        Where type is the string âseqâ. This pattern identifies a Sequence of Canvases with a label given in the parameter name. The recommended default name is ânormalâ, and further may be used for objects with alternative sequences. Dereferencing will provide the same behavior as for Manifests above.

                        Range:
                        scheme://host/prefix/identifier/type/name[.fmt]

                        Where type is the string ârangeâ. This pattern identifies a Range of Canvases, or parts thereof. There is no recommended default name as Ranges are not required in the model. The behavior is as for Manifests.

                        Canvas:
                        scheme://host/prefix/identifier/type/name[.fmt]

                        Where type is the string âcanvasâ. This pattern identifies an individual Canvas. Although it should be unnecessary to dereference a Canvas directly, it should provide a description of itself following a 303 redirect that includes at least label, height and width.

                        Annotation Lists:
                        scheme://host/prefix/identifier/type/annoclass/bodyclass/canvasname[.fmt]

                        Where type is the string âlistâ.

                        The parameter annoclass is one of the following three options at conformance levels 0 and 1, and may be any string at level 2:

                        âallâ: All Annotations should be included in the list.
                        âpaintingâ: Only Annotations that paint resources to the canvas should be included.
                        â!paintingâ: Only Annotations that do NOT paint resources to the canvas should be included, such as comments, references, and so forth.
                        The parameter bodyclass determines the type of resource that is being associated with the Canvas. It must be one of the following options at conformance levels 0 and 1, and may be any string at level 2:

                        âallâ: All resource types should be included in the list
                        âimageâ: Only image resources should be included
                        âtextâ: Only textual resources should be included
                        âaudioâ: Only audio resources should be included
                        âvideoâ: Only video resources should be included
                        âotherâ: Only resources other than image, text, audio or video should be included
                        The parameter canvasname is the same as the name parameter of the Canvas URI, and only annotations that target that canvas or part thereof are included in the list.

                        For example, to retrieve the list of annotations that paint text onto folio âf1râ in JSON-LD:
                        http://www.shared-canvas.org/mss/m804/list/painting/text/f1r.json

                        Annotations:
                        scheme://host/prefix/identifier/type/canvasname/name.fmt

                        Where type is the string âannoâ, and canvasname is the name of one of the canvases being targeted by the annotation. As Annotations do not have a non-information resource, the format must be given, and should be the same as the resource that is referring to it. For example, if the above annotation list in JSON refers to an annotation with the name âline1â, it would also use the JSON format:

                        http://www.shared-canvas.org/mss/m804/anno/f1r/line1.json

                        Other Reserved Types:
                        The types âimageâ and âresourceâ are reserved.

                        A resource with type âimageâ should then obey the IIIF Image API, as if the path up to âimageâ was the prefix. The identifier of the image in the IIIF API should be the same as the name of the canvas, unless multiple depictions are available from the same system. In that case each should start with the name of the canvas followed by some distinguishing suffix.

                        The âresourceâ type is reserved for further APIs that may be defined later.

                        Search API

                        The search API URI pattern is:

                        scheme://host/prefix/identifier/type/annoclass/annotator.fmt?query

                        where type is the string âsearchâ.

                        The search API response is identical to the response for lists above, but is not limited to annotations targeting a single Canvas. The annoclass parameter is the same as in list.

                        The annotator parameter has the following options:

                        âallâ: Search for annotations with any annotator
                        âmeâ: In an authenticated session, search for annotations created by the current user
                        identity: The identity of the agent responsible for the annotation in the local system. It should take the form of an email address or OpenID URI.
                        The query parameters are the set of parameters exposed by the SOLR system, and three must be supported:

                        q=keywords: The query string entered by the user
                        start=integer: The start position within the matched result set (default 0)
                        rows=integer: The number of results to be returned in the response (default system specific)
                        Thus:

                        http://www.shared-canvas.org/mss/m804/search/comment/me.json?q=king

                        would return a list in JSON-LD format of those comment annotations on any Canvas that is part of the m804 object, written by the authenticated user that contain the word âkingâ.

                        This is a scheme particular to the DMS Commons requirements and does not cover general Annotation use cases.

                        IIIF Search
                        As the scope of Search within the IIIF is limited to within a single known item, rather than discovery of the item or across multiple known items, the required functionality for the searches is limited. The set of resources to be searched are the Annotations that associate content resources or comments with the Canvases. Content resources and Comments should be kept separate, and given different access points to allow searches to be performed for one or the other. For ease of implementation and specification, only a single search field and a single term are possible at once. Thus it is not possible to combine fields with booleans (and/or/not). Boolean or searches are possible through multiple requests. If multiple fields or terms were possible, then precedence and separators would be necessary.

                        Search Fields:
                        hasTarget  The identifier of the target of the annotation, typically a Canvas URI
                        hasBody  The identifier of the body of the annotation
                        annotator  The identifier of the author of the annotation
                        annotatedAfter  All annotations created after the given date, in iso8601 format
                        hasBodyKeywords  Comma separated set of keywords to search in the body (OR)
                        query  A âmagicâ do-the-right-thing google style search
                        For target and body searches, the service should allow the URI to be either the Specific Resource (such as a segment of a resource) or the full resource. Thus a hasTarget search for Canvas1 would return all annotations that target Canvas1 or any part of it. The term must be percent encoded, including especially the characters: . / & # : and ? The structure of the URI for a IIIF Search API is:
                        http://server/[prefix/]objectId/type/field/[term][.ext]
                        where:
                        server  The domain name for the search service
                        prefix  An optional prefix, such as âiiifâ or âsearchâ
                        objectId  The identifier for the object, encoded as per the Image API
                        type  The type of annotation, currently âcommentâ or âcontentâ
                        field  One of the search fields above
                        term  The search term, URI encoded
                        ext  One of âxmlâ, âttlâ, or âjsonâ
                        The response format is always an ORE Resource Map, in one of the RDF/XML, Turtle, or JSON-LD formats as determined by the format parameter. If not supplied, then RDF/XML is assumed and the service should redirect with a 303 response to the .xml representation. The URI without the format is, thus, the identifier of the Aggregation. If the term is supplied, then the response is an Aggregation of Annotations. The Annotations may be provided inline or only the URI given, in which case the client must dereference them separately.
                        <A1/term1.ttl> a ore:ResourceMap ;
                        ore:describes  .
                        <A1/term1> a ore:Aggregation ;
                        ore:aggregates <Anno1>, <Anno2>, <Anno3> ;
                        If the term is omitted then the response is the set of terms available (a browse or scan service), expressed as an Aggregation of the above Aggregations.
                        <A1.ttl> a ore:ResourceMap ;
                        ore:describes <A1> .
